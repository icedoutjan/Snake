# Snake
a simple Snake game for Arduino 
I wrote the code as a final project in college

# ToDo 
1. add the ability to play with joystick instead of keypad
2. add the ability to display some data on a lcd display
3. add better comments
4. performance improvement

# issues (i mean features)
1. it seemes like the arduino crashed if the snake is too long
2. evereytime the snake eats the 0 0 address of the martix turned on

# ideas 
- for the arduino crash problem a easy fix would be to limit the length of the snake
- to check the core dump could also help
