# Snake
a simple Snake game for Arduino 
I wrote the code as a final project in college

# ToDo
1. a clean up of the code 
2. splitting the code into different files
3. add better comments
4. performance improvement

# issues (i mean features)
1. it seemes like the arduino crashed if the snake is too long
2. evereytime the snake eats the 0 0 address of the martix turned on
