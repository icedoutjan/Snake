# Snake
a simple Snake game for Arduino 
I wrote the code as a final project in college

# ToDo 
1. performance improvement

# issues (i mean features)
1. it seemes like the arduino crashed if the snake is too long


# ideas 
- for the arduino crash problem a easy fix would be to limit the length of the snake
